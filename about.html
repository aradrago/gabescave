<p> Hi, my name is Gabriel and I am an Industrial Engineer. I like create clean and functional things.
</p>
  <h3>Background</h3>
    I grew up most of my life in the south of Brazil, in the green city of Curitiba (fun fact: the city is known as being the mother of many public transportation systems such as Los Angeles, Mexico City, Lima, Jakarta, Las Vegas and Buenos Aires.
    You can check this out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rede_Integrada_de_Transporte">here</a>).
    <br>
    Anyways, then I moved to Canada during High School. After a failed attempt at a gap year and a successful lockdown year, I went to Germany to persue my Industrial Engineering Degree.
    During which I had the opportunity to study in the most sustainable university in Germany and go to other places to study their impact. Namely in Sunyani, Ghana, as part of the ZECURA Travelling Universities Project.
    Plus had the opportunity to do an Exchange Semester in MÃ©rida, Mexico, where the Mayans used to live and the food is delicious. There I studied Space Integration, Sustainable Urban Design, and Geometry.
