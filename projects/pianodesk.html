  <h2>Piano Desk</h2>
  <p>For this desk I wanted something that could neatly stack up a desk, a piano, and a TV. Looking back at it, I bought the piano only to fit in this project and never really played it. It was quite a thing for me and I invested probably the most amount of time with all the little details of any of the furniture I built. The photos of the prototype and process are down below. The piano desk ended up looking like this: </p>
